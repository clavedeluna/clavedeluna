I'm Dani, a professional programmer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on maintaining various popular Python projects including Pylint and [codemodder](https://github.com/pixee/codemodder-python).
- ðŸ˜„ My favorite stuff is taking old issues and fixing them. Nothing like the endorphin hit from getting that issue list shorter and shorter! I focus on maintenance work, refactors, linting, and testing. This is my way of making the world a better place, one line of tested code at a time.
